Cardiac arrhythmias encompass a range of disorders characterized by abnormal electrical activity of the heart. Common types include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and premature ventricular contractions. Clinical presentation varies from palpitations and syncope to sudden cardiac arrest. Diagnosis relies on ECG, Holter monitoring, and electrophysiological studies. Management may include rate or rhythm control, anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for malignant ventricular arrhythmias.
